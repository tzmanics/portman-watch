    context: 'Rob Portman voted on Tuesday to silence Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, for reading a 1986 letter from Corretta Scott King to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the nomination of Jeff Sessions for federal Judge. Warren was reading the letter on the Senate floor during debate over the confirmation of Senator Sessions for U.S. Attorney General. Rob agreed with the chair that Warren was in violation of rule XIX of the senate, which states that "No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator."',
